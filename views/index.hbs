        Want a new perspective on an object? This is a project that transforms facts about objects into narrative versions of the art pages on the museumâ€™s website. When you hit a different route, you can swap story templates of and see different narrative or creative versions of the object page.

        Currently, the website has two versions of stories. The first version renders the object through the two basic Mad Libs templates, depending on their object type (coins or non-coins). 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/object/168614">An example of a coin</li>
        <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/object/292540">An example of a sculpture</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/object/230457">An example of a painting</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To check out any objects from the collection, follow the URL template: /object/OBJECTID
    </p>

        The second version consists of creative narrative fragments. One fragment is about detecting the eye gaze direction of the figure in a portrait and displaying short poetic lines describing them. The other fragment is a first-person narrative of an object's history of displacement. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/object/178609/coolpage">An example of a portrait that looks to the right</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/object/209167/coolpage">An example of an object with a history of displacement</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To swap to this version of object stories, just add /coolpage to the end of your URL above, namely in the format: /object/OBJECTID/coolpage
